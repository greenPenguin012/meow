Decentralized Library Smart Contract

Project Description:
This is a beginner-friendly Solidity smart contract that creates a decentralized library system on the blockchain. Users can add books, borrow them, and return them â€” without needing a central authority. The blockchain keeps everything transparent and secure.

What it does:

Allows users to add new books with title and author

Lets users borrow available books

Prevents borrowing a book that is already borrowed

Ensures only the borrower can return the book

Stores data publicly on the blockchain

Tracks how many books are in the library

Features:

Simple and beginner-friendly smart contract logic

Fully decentralized functionality

Borrowing and returning is verified by wallet addresses

Viewable data for transparency and trust

Technologies Used:

Solidity (Ethereum Smart Contracts)

Remix IDE for deployment/testing

Any EVM compatible blockchain network

How to Run:

Open Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org

Create a new file named DecentralizedLibrary.sol

Paste the smart contract code

Compile using Solidity version 0.8.x

Deploy using JavaScript VM or a test network with MetaMask

Future Improvements:

Token rewards for contributors

Deadlines and fines for late returns

NFT-based book identity and ownership

IPFS support for digital books

More detailed book metadata and search features

Admin/verification system for book submissions
